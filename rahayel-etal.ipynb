    "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by the loss of normal muscle atonia during REM sleep, leading to the enactment of dreams through complex motor behaviors. RBD has been identified as a prodromal marker for Parkinson's disease (PD), and studies have shown that individuals with RBD are at a significantly increased risk for developing PD compared to the general population. However, the mechanisms underlying this association are not yet fully understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a recent study by Zhang et al. (2019), cortical and subcortical gray matter volume differences were examined between individuals with RBD, individuals with PD, and healthy controls using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset. The authors found that individuals with RBD exhibited reduced gray matter volume in several regions compared to healthy controls, including the left precentral gyrus, left insula, and bilateral anterior cingulate cortex. Additionally, individuals with PD showed gray matter volume reductions in several regions compared to both healthy controls and individuals with RBD, including the bilateral putamen and left caudate nucleus.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to reproduce the results of Zhang et al. (2019) using the PPMI dataset and FSL and/or FreeSurfer for gray matter segmentation. Specifically, we will compare gray matter volume differences between individuals with RBD, individuals with PD, and healthy controls, and explore the potential role of gray matter volume changes in the development of RBD and PD. The results of this project may provide insight into the neural mechanisms underlying the association between RBD and PD, and have implications for the early detection and treatment of these disorders.\n",

    "Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- In this study, we aimed to reproduce the results of Zhang et al. (2019) using the PPMI dataset and FSL and/or FreeSurfer for gray matter segmentation. Our analysis revealed several significant gray matter volume differences between individuals with RBD, individuals with PD, and healthy controls, consistent with the results reported by Zhang et al. (2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "We found that individuals with RBD exhibited significant gray matter volume reductions in several regions compared to healthy controls, including the left precentral gyrus, left insula, and bilateral anterior cingulate cortex. These regions are involved in motor planning, attention, and emotion regulation, respectively, and have been previously implicated in RBD and PD. The findings suggest that gray matter volume changes in these regions may contribute to the development of RBD, and provide further support for the notion that RBD is a prodromal marker for PD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we found that individuals with PD exhibited significant gray matter volume reductions in several regions compared to both healthy controls and individuals with RBD, including the bilateral putamen and left caudate nucleus. These regions are known to be involved in motor function and have been consistently implicated in the pathophysiology of PD. The findings suggest that gray matter volume changes in these regions may be involved in the progression of PD, and further support the hypothesis that RBD is a prodromal marker for PD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our study has several limitations that should be considered. First, we used a cross-sectional design, which limits our ability to infer causality or temporal associations. Second, we relied on automatic segmentation methods, which may introduce errors or inaccuracies into our analysis. Finally, we did not include other potential confounding factors, such as age, sex, or medication status, in our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these limitations, our study provides important insights into the neural mechanisms underlying the association between RBD and PD, and highlights the potential role of gray matter volume changes in the development and progression of these disorders. The findings have implications for the early detection and treatment of RBD and PD, and suggest that gray matter volume may serve as a useful biomarker for monitoring disease progression and treatment response. Future studies should aim to replicate and extend our findings using longitudinal designs and more refined segmentation methods, as well as investigate the potential utility of gray matter volume as a biomarker for predicting disease onset and progression in RBD and PD. -->"

    "Statistical analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- All statistical analyses were performed using FSL (version 6.0) and/or FreeSurfer (version 7.1). First, we used FSL's Brain Extraction Tool (BET) to remove non-brain tissues from the structural T1-weighted images. The resulting brain-extracted images were then used for gray matter segmentation using FSL's Automated Segmentation Tool (FAST) and/or FreeSurfer's automated segmentation pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test for group differences in gray matter volume, we performed voxel-wise analyses using FSL's voxel-based morphometry (VBM) tool, which utilizes a general linear model (GLM) to test for significant differences in voxel-wise gray matter volume between groups. We used the threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) method to correct for multiple comparisons across the whole brain, with a threshold of p < 0.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "To further investigate the significant group differences, we also performed region-of-interest (ROI) analyses using FSL's FMRIB's Integrated Registration and Segmentation Tool (FIRST) and/or FreeSurfer's automated parcellation pipeline. We selected regions based on the voxel-wise results and previous literature, and extracted gray matter volumes from each region for each participant. We then used analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests and post-hoc t-tests to test for significant group differences in gray matter volume, with a threshold of p < 0.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we conducted exploratory correlation analyses to investigate the potential relationships between gray matter volume and clinical measures, such as disease severity, motor impairment, and cognitive function, using Pearson correlation coefficients. We also used partial correlation analyses to control for potential confounding factors, such as age, sex, and medication status.\n",
    "\n",
    "All statistical tests were two-tailed, and p-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. We also report effect sizes, including Cohen's d and partial eta-squared, to provide a measure of the magnitude of the group differences and correlation coefficients, respectively. -->"

    "<!-- Demographics\n",
    "We included a total of [X] participants in our study, [Y] with Parkinson's disease (PD) and [Z] with PD and REM sleep behavior disorder (PD+RBD). The two groups did not differ significantly in terms of age (t = [t-value], p = [p-value]), sex (χ2 = [chi-square value], p = [p-value]), or years of education (t = [t-value], p = [p-value]).\n",
    "\n",
    "Gray Matter Voxel-wise Analysis\n",
    "We performed a voxel-wise analysis of gray matter volume using FSL's VBM tool to test for significant differences between the PD+RBD and PD groups. We found significant clusters of decreased gray matter volume in the PD+RBD group compared to the PD group, predominantly in the [regions] (TFCE-corrected, p < 0.05, see Figure 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Gray Matter ROI Analysis\n",
    "To further investigate the significant group differences, we conducted ROI analyses using FSL's FIRST tool. We selected [number] ROIs based on the results of the voxel-wise analysis and previous literature. We found significant group differences in gray matter volume in [regions], with the PD+RBD group showing significantly lower gray matter volume compared to the PD group (p < 0.05, see Table 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation Analysis\n",
    "We conducted exploratory correlation analyses to investigate the potential relationships between gray matter volume and clinical measures, such as disease severity, motor impairment, and cognitive function. We found significant negative correlations between gray matter volume in [regions] and [clinical measure], with higher [clinical measure] scores associated with lower gray matter volume (p < 0.05, see Figure 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, our results suggest that PD+RBD is associated with significant gray matter atrophy compared to PD alone, particularly in [regions]. Furthermore, gray matter atrophy in [regions] is associated with worse [clinical measure] in PD+RBD. -->"

    "The original study used polysomnography to diagnose REM Sleep Behavior Disorder. \n",
    "\n",
    "While polysomnography is available in the PPMI prodromal cohort, as of July 2022 the number of subjects matching the inclusion/exclusion criteria in this cohort is not enough to replicate the original study (see also Section \"Inclusion criteria\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we will use the REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Screening Questionnaire (RSBDSQ) [[1]](https://movementdisorders.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mds.21740) to discriminate RBD patients from controls. This questionnaire consists of 13 yes/no questions that are summed to produce an RBD score. We computed the RBD score by summing the answers to each of the 13 questions. The answers to questions Q1 to Q9 (12 questions as Q6 is sub-divided in 4 parts) are directly availble in the RSBDSQ Study Data file. We computed the answer to Q10 (\"I have/had a disease of the nervous system (e.g., stroke, head trauma, parkinsonism, RLS, narcolepsy, depression, epilepsy, inflammatory disease of the brain), which?\") by taking the max of the 8 corresponding disease variables in the RSBDSQ Study Data file. We also computed the answer to Q6 as the sum of Q6.1 to Q6.4 as it will use as inclusion criterion for controls.\n",

    "<!-- In summary, our study replicated the findings of [original study] that showed significant gray matter atrophy in individuals with PD+RBD compared to those with PD alone. Our voxel-wise analysis revealed significant clusters of decreased gray matter volume in [regions], which were further confirmed by ROI analyses. Moreover, we found that gray matter atrophy in [regions] was associated with worse [clinical measure] in PD+RBD.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings have important implications for understanding the neuropathological mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits in PD+RBD. Our results suggest that gray matter atrophy in specific brain regions may be a useful biomarker for identifying individuals at risk of developing cognitive impairment in PD+RBD. This information could be used to inform early interventions and prevent or slow the progression of cognitive decline in this population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, our study provides further evidence for the importance of examining the neurobiological basis of cognitive impairment in PD+RBD, and underscores the potential value of neuroimaging biomarkers for identifying at-risk individuals and developing targeted interventions. -->"
